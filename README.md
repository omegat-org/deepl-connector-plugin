# DeepL Connector Plugin for OmegaT

This repository serves a new DeepL connector plugin for OmegaT.  

DeepL has announced the deprecation of the V1 API.  
As a result, the genuine DeepL connector bundled with OmegaT versions 6.0.1 and earlier, which relies on the V1 API method, has stopped working.

## Use of DeepL library

The plugin depends on the DeepL library licensed under the MIT license, which supports the DeepL V2 API. 

## How to Contribute

We encourage interested developers to get involved in the development of this plugin. Contributions can include:
- Improving the performance or features of the plugin.
- Fixing any potential issues with compatibility or functionality.

Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for review.
