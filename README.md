# DeepL Connector Plugin for OmegaT

DeepL has announced the deprecation of the API using the HTTP `GET` method.  
As a result, the genuine DeepL connector bundled with OmegaT versions 6.0.1 and earlier,
which relies on the `GET` method, has stopped working.

## About This Project

This repository serves as a placeholder for the development of a new DeepL connector plugin for OmegaT.  
The OmegaT community welcomes contributions from developers who are interested in enabling integration with DeepL.

## Use of DeepL library

The DeepL library is licensed under the MIT license. That support DeepL API using the HTTP `POST` method. 
The connector plugin for OmegaT uses the DeepL library and supports DeepL API V1.

## How to Contribute

We encourage interested developers to get involved in the development of this plugin. Contributions can include:
- Migrating the connector to use the updated DeepL API with supported methods (e.g., HTTP `POST`).
- Improving the performance or features of the plugin.
- Fixing any potential issues with compatibility or functionality.

Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for review.
